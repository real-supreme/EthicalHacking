# EthicalHacking
This is a project-on-progress done by Emmanuel Smiju (real-supreme). I am working on a Ethical Hacking Project, focusing on Brute Forcing, and this is my outcome so far. I am open to suggestions :)

## How to start?
The main.py contains the main files, along with multi-threading feature. You may add `password.txt` files and banners.txt files. 
```python main.py``` will run the file.

### Documentation
The files will be documented soon. As this project is a **work-in-progress**, Documentation of files is yet to be completed!
